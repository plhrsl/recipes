    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"<em>We discovered this easy French toast recipe in Mexico. We couldn't figure out what made the French toast so
            delicious until we learned the secret was vanilla. Since then, we've added a touch of vanilla to our waffle
            and pancake recipes, and it makes all the difference.</em>" â€”Joe and Bobbi Schott, Castroville, Texas</p>
